## Introduction
REIT Management was built to streamline the communication between Renters, Property Managers and Contractors. 

As a renter - Report issues with your unit.  View the status of those your property and see when service is being schedules. 
As a contractor - See all issues that are assigned to you. Update service request status and schedule appointments from REIT Manager. 
As an Admin - Assign service request to verified contractors.  Close out open service items. And manage all invoicing.
